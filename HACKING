Getting started with Debsources development
===========================================


Local Debsources deployment
---------------------------

- $ git clone https://anonscm.debian.org/git/qa/debsources.git
  $ cd debsources/

- to test the updater, and subsequently run the webapp on it, you will need a
  (partial) Debian source mirror on your development machine.  To that end, you
  might want to use the data from the Debsources testsuite, which is shipped
  via a separate Git submodule rooted at testdata/, so:

  $ git submodule update --init

  The testdata Git repository is ~150 MB, so it might take a while to retrieve.

- create a PostgreSQL database for use by Debsources, e.g.:

  $  createdb debsources

  (as user postgres or equivalent)

- create the DB schema:

  $ bin/debsources-dbadmin --createdb postgresql:///debsources

  where debsources is the DB name. The last parameter must be a valid
  SQLAlchemy database URL; see
  http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls for
  details on how to connect to remote databases.

- $ cp doc/examples/sample-config.local.ini etc/config.local.ini 

  (when etc/config.local.ini, debsources will ignore etc/config.ini, and use
  the ".local." variant as its main configuration file)

- edit etc/config.local.ini and adapt it to your needs.

  To play with Debsources for development reasons, it should be enough to
  change `db_uri` (the same you used above for bin/debsources-dbadmin) and
  `root_dir` (the absolute path of your local Debsources Git repo) in the
  top-level `[DEFAULT]` section of the configuration file.

- do an update run:

  $ bin/debsources-update -vv

- run the webapp:

  $ python/run_webapp.py 
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  * Restarting with reloader

  you can now visit the above URL with your browser and verify that everything
  is OK.
