Webapp bugs:

* Line highlighting 

  When we highlight a line, we have to use a display:inline tag (whose
  rendering isn't cool, because an highlighted block doesn't have the
  same width verywhere). With a display:blog tag, newlines are added
  by the browser/highlight.js (?), because tags conflicts with
  highlight.js tags (when a hl.js lexem is multiline).
  Try to highlight lines 3-4 of this to see the bug:
  def hello():
     """aaa
     aaa
     """ zzz = 3
     
  Edit: the browser close tags automatically, and since our tags
  aren't correct (ie
  <span class="string"><div class="highlight">foo</span></div>
  ), closing display:block tags are inserted.

 Debugging: maybe with inline-block and other css tricks
