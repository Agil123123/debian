<h2>{{ self.title() }}</h2>

<p>Debsources provide access to the source code of
  the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> operating system.</p>

<p>You can start by browsing through the list of source packages, or searching
  for a particular one based on its name. Multiple versions of each source
  package might be available &mdash; currently, versions coming from
  <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/">stable</a>,
  <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/">testing</a>,
  <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/">unstable</a>, and
  <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental">experimental</a> are
  available.</p>

<p>Once chosen a specific version, you can browse through the source package
  structure to inspect individual source files. If you have Javascript enabled
  in your browser, source code will be syntax-highlighted and you will be able
  to point to individual lines; otherwise the raw file will be returned.</p>

<p>You can also use Debsources programmatically, or simply as a stable base to
  point to particular lines in a source file, possibly adding custom
  annotations to them. But hey, read the <a href="/doc">doc</a>!</p>
