<p>
Debsources is aimed to provide an easy access to the sources of Debian
packages. You can simply navigate into the packages list, or search
for one in particular. The source files will be syntax-highlighted if
you have enabled Javascript on your browser.
</p>
<p>
You can also use Debsources as an API to point a particular place in a
file from a source package, and possibly add a message in front of
this. Everything is detailed in the <a href="{{ url_for('doc') }}">API
    documentation</a>.
