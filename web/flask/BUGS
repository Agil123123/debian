* Line highlighting 

  When we highlight a line, we have to use a display:line tag (whose
  rendering isn't cool, because an highlighted block doesn't have the
  same width verywhere). With a display:blog tag, newlines are added
  by the browser/highlight.js (?), because tags conflicts with
  highlight.js tags (when a hl.js lexem is multiline).
  Try to highlight lines 3-4 of this to see the bug:
  def hello():
     """aaa
     aaa
     """ zzz = 3

  Debugging: maybe with inline-block and other css tricks
