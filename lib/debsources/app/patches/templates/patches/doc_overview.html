<h3>Debpatches Services</h3>
<p>Once chosen a specific package version, you view the <b>summary</b> of a package.<br />
  If the patch format is 3.0, then the page will provide the list of patches with the following information:
  <ul>
    <li>links to view and download each patch</li>
    <li>the file-deltas</li>
    <li>the description and bug number if they exist</li>
  </ul>
  The file deltas are parsed to provide links to Debsources from the mentioned files.<br />
  When a specific patch is chosen, the service is syntax highlighting the patch with a diff format.
  <p>You can consult the <a href="{{ url_for('doc.doc_url') }}"><b>URL
  schemes</b></a> to get the relevant information on how to navigate in the package summary or the patch view.</p>

<p>You can also use Debpatches programmatically via its
  <a href="{{ url_for('doc.doc_api') }}"><b>API</b></a>.</p>
