# List information about source package found in a given debsources
# instance. Will output two files ($1 and $2, respectively): a SOURCES_LIST
# file and a METADATA_LIST file.
#
# SOURCES_LIST format: "PACKAGE\tVERSION\tAREA\tDSC\tDEST\n"
#
# - PACKAGE is the source package name
# - VERSION is the source version
# - AREA is the archive area of origin, i.e. one of main, contrib, non-free
# - DSC is the absolute path to the package .dsc in the source mirror.  DSC can
#   have the special value "NONE" for source packages that exist in the local
#   debsources instance, but are no longer part of the local source mirror
#   (i.e. disappeared packages not yet expired).
# - DEST is the absolute path to the package unpacking directory
#
# METADATA_LIST format: "PACKAGE\tVERSION\tMETADATA_KEY\tMETADATA_VALUE\n"
#
# - METADATA_KEY is the kind of metadata being described. Currently supported:
#   - "suite" to describe the suite the package is in, e.g. squeeze, wheezy,
#     sid. The special suite value "cruft" is used to denote packages that no
#     longer show up in any of the indexed suite, but have not yet been garbage
#     collected by debsources (see $expire_days in config.sh).
# - METADATA_VALUE is the actual metadata value. Its format depends on the kind
#   of metadata. Metadata with list values will have multiple entries for the
#   same <PACKAGE, VERSION, METADATA_KEY> triplets.

# Depends: dctrl-tools, moreutils
