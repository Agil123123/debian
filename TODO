* TODO should the first page be static?				   :web:perf:
  (or maybe cached?) -> strict to set packages_prefixes static
* TODO integrate prefix generation into cron jobs		       :cron:
  - currently it needs ad-hoc runs
  - also: it currently generates a python module outside /cache, which breaks
    the code/data separation
* TODO search based on the file name				 :web:search:
  should be feasible, if the mlocate database is to be believed. Maybe we
  should simply use it, making the indexing available *in* the VM?
* TODO [0/1] integration with http://codesearch.debian.net	 :web:search:
** forward: have a search box on sources.d.n that search there
** backward: have search results there pointing back to sources.d.n
** TODO contact: stapelberg@d.o
* TODO symbolic link for use with tango icons			 :web:apache:
  currently in static/img/
* TODO highlight.js is way slower				   :web:perf:
  since it is retrieved from /javascript/highlight
  
* TODO bounding box of source code line is too narrow		    :web:css:
  when using highlight.js styles with a background (e.g. "default"), that gives
  unpleasant visual results

* TODO replace etc/webconfig.py with a Python ini-like conffile	   :web:conf:
  Rationale: a Python module is dangerous and the only fancy functionality we
  need is interpolation, which is supported by ConfigParser. The relative
  import trick used by app.config.from_pyfile can be used for ConfigParser
  instead.
* TODO A download link to the original source package         :web:interface:
  files that the currently shown package is indexed from would be useful.
* TODO A link to the PTS of the package as well,              :web:interface:
  just to be able to click from and to Debian services.
* TODO The .pc/ directory should probably be hidden.          :web:interface:
