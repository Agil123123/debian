* TODO should the first page be static?
  (or maybe cached?)
* TODO search based on the file name
  should be feasible, if the mlocate database is to be believed. Maybe we
  should simply use it, making the indexing available *in* the VM?
* TODO [0/1] integration with http://codesearch.debian.net
** forward: have a search box on sources.d.n that search there
** backward: have search results there pointing back to sources.d.n
** TODO contact: stapelberg@d.o
* TODO API is currently not an API
  is more of an URL scheme (and it's good to have!). But we do need an API,
  e.g. rooted at /api/ which send answers in a machine parseable format such as
  Json
* TODO API method to retrieve the complete list of available packages
  rationale: currently the only way to get them is via a paginated long
  list. Not. Handy.
** inspiration:
   http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=mirror/snapshot.debian.org.git;a=blob_plain;f=API
* TODO symbolic link for use with tango icons (currently in static/img/)
* TODO highlight.js is way slower
  since it is retrieved from /javascript/highlight


* TODO xsl files aren't considered as text?
  http://sources.debian.net/src/libical-parser-html-perl/1.07-1/lib/iCal/Parser/HTML/stylesheet

* TODO ADA colorisation (considered as brainfuck :D)
  http://sources.debian.net/src/adabrowse/4.0.3-5/ad-compiler.adb


* TODO LOGGING_FILE entry in webconfig.py
  Q: do we really need logging other than the Apache one? WSGI can log via
  its appplication server...
  (also it should be LOGFILE, if any :-))
