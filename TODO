* TODO OCaml files, e.g.
  http://sources.debian.net/data/main/o/ocaml/4.00.1-1/bytecomp/bytesections.ml
** should be fixed when switching to python-magic
* TODO 500 status code for changelog
  e.g.:
** KO http://sources.debian.net/src/ocaml/4.00.1-1/Changes/
** OK http://sources.debian.net/src/cairo-ocaml/1:1.2.0-2/ChangeLog/
** OK http://sources.debian.net/src/librapi2/0.15-2.1/ChangeLog/
   although I've found some "ChangeLog" named entry that fail
** KO http://sources.debian.net/src/wesnoth-1.11/1:1.11.2-1/changelog/
* TODO file URLs end with trailing '/'
  e.g. http://sources.debian.net/src/librapi2/0.15-2.1/Makefile.am/
  not nice :-)
* TODO should the first page be static?
  (or maybe cached?)
* TODO search based on the file name
  should be feasible, if the mlocate database is to be believed. Maybe we
  should simply use it, making the indexing available *in* the VM?
* TODO [0/1] integration with http://codesearch.debian.net
** forward: have a search box on sources.d.n that search there
** backward: have search results there pointing back to sources.d.n
** TODO contact: Michael Stapelberg <stapelberg@debian.org>
* TODO API is currently not an API
  is more of an URL scheme (and it's good to have!). But we do need an API,
  e.g. rooted at /api/ which send answers in a machine parseable format such as
  Json
* TODO API method to retrieve the complete list of available packages
  rationale: currently the only way to get them is via a paginated long
  list. Not. Handy.
** inspiration:
   http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=mirror/snapshot.debian.org.git;a=blob_plain;f=API
* TODO symbolic link for use with tango icons (currently in static/img/)
