* TODO should the first page be static?				   :web:perf:
  (or maybe cached?) -> strict to set packages_prefixes static
* TODO integrate prefix generation into cron jobs		       :cron:
  - currently it needs ad-hoc runs
  - also: it currently generates a python module outside /cache, which breaks
    the code/data separation
* TODO search based on the file name				 :web:search:
  should be feasible, if the mlocate database is to be believed. Maybe we
  should simply use it, making the indexing available *in* the VM?
* TODO symbolic link for use with tango icons			 :web:apache:
  currently in static/img/
* TODO highlight.js is way slower				   :web:perf:
  since it is retrieved from /javascript/highlight
  
* TODO replace etc/webconfig.py with a Python ini-like conffile	   :web:conf:
  Rationale: a Python module is dangerous and the only fancy functionality we
  need is interpolation, which is supported by ConfigParser. The relative
  import trick used by app.config.from_pyfile can be used for ConfigParser
  instead.
* TODO set "path" for files (after '/' in the header of base.html       :web:
* TODO highlight #Lxxx lines					     :web:ui:

* TODO check symlink dereferencing                             :web:security:
  if it's outside of the pakage -> 403 error
  inside the package -> redirect appropriately
