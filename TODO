* TODO should the first page be static?
  (or maybe cached?) -> strict to set packages_prefixes static
* TODO search based on the file name
  should be feasible, if the mlocate database is to be believed. Maybe we
  should simply use it, making the indexing available *in* the VM?
* TODO [0/1] integration with http://codesearch.debian.net
** forward: have a search box on sources.d.n that search there
** backward: have search results there pointing back to sources.d.n
** TODO contact: stapelberg@d.o
* TODO symbolic link for use with tango icons (currently in static/img/)
* TODO highlight.js is way slower
  since it is retrieved from /javascript/highlight

* TODO xsl files aren't considered as text?
  because text is not in 'application/xml'
  other mime types return False as well

* TODO ADA colorisation (considered as brainfuck :D)
  http://sources.debian.net/src/adabrowse/4.0.3-5/ad-compiler.adb
  extensions list in webconfig

* TODO LOGGING_FILE entry in webconfig.py
  Q: do we really need logging other than the Apache one? WSGI can log via
  its appplication server...
  (also it should be LOGFILE, if any :-))

* TODO trailing slashes (have come back with a littl bug)
* TODO encapsulate SourceCodeIterator in SourceCode
* TODO "data last updated: ..." footer
  including cache/last-update, which is generated at each pulse
