Debsources on Mobile
--------------------

Enabling Debsources to work on mobile browsers, via an hybrid
(desktop/mobile) design, is an interesting and useful challenge. A
library such as Bootstrap should be used. Additionally, the interface
could be more dynamic, using ajax requests, and libraries such as
jQuery and Angular. An SPA (single page application) would be very
handy, keeping in mind compatibility with text-based javascriptless
browsers is needed.

On a second level, a native app could be developed, leveraging some
new possibilities (saving files, editing them and producing patches (like
with the browser extension), etc). There is a design challenge
involved here, and also a technology choice (e.g. Cordova/PhoneGap
vs. real native).

Support of other operating systems
----------------------------------

Support of security.debian.org, and other operating systems, poses few
challenges:
- refactoring (adding a table for the different archives, changing
  primary keys, lots of UI changes, etc).
- support of the updates coming from different archives through
  different protocols.
- disk size: implement deduplication, at either block or file level
  (see btrfs, mongodb/gridfs), or by hand through the files table and
  its checksums. This can be done:
  - through hard links at update time
  - through hard links via a cronjob (involving race conditions and
    similar challenges).

Support of other hashing algorithms
-----------------------------------

In the files table, we currently only compute the sha256 sum. It would
be interesting to have other checksums.
