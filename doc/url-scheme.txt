In the following, SOURCES refers to the root URL of debsources installation.

Raw data is available at http://SOURCES/db/, e.g.

  http://SOURCES/db/main/p/python3.2/3.2.3-7/Python/ast.c

That URL scheme is subject to changes, do not rely on it.

The stable URL scheme to access source files is rooted at http://SOURCES/src/
and is as follows:

  /src/SRC_PKG/SRC_VERSION/
  /src/SRC_PKG/latest/	# most recent source version available
  /src/SRC_PKG/SUITE/	# source version in SUITE
			# e.g. squeeze, wheezy, sid
			# e.g. stable, testing, unstable, experimental

The following redirects are in place to implement it:

  /src/SRC_PKG/SRC_VERSION -> /db/COMPONENT/HASH/SRC_PKG/SRC_VERSION

e.g.:

  /src/python3.2/3.2.3-7/ -> /db/main/p/python3.2/3.2.3-7/
