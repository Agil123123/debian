Test runner
===========

Debsources test suite is managed with [Nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/).
To run the test suite execute the following from Debsources top-level dir:

	$ nosetests -v debsources/tests/

Check [Nose documentation](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for more
advanced options, including how to only run specific tests, based on
attributes.


Test attributes
---------------

To get a list of available test attributes you might try something like:

	$ rgrep -h @attr debsources/tests/ | tr -d '[:blank:]' | sort -u


Test Postgres DB
================

To be able to run the tests tagged with attribute 'postgres' you need to have a
local PostgreSQL installation with the ability for the user running the tests
to create (and destroy) a database called 'debsources-test'.  On that database
you should have enough privileges to create/drop tables, and perform
select/insert/delete queries.

If needed, you can change the name of the test database by changing
TEST_DB_NAME in the tesdata.py module.


Test data
=========

Large test data for Debsources, including a sample mirror and reference
database, are kept in a separate Git repository to avoid cluttering and making
too heavy Debsources development repository. The test data repository is
registered as a submodule under the `testdata/` directory.

Upon first clone of Debsources repository you might initialize and clone the
testdata submodule by executing:

	$ git submodule update --init

On successful execution the above will populate `testdata/`.

For more information check
[Git submodule documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).
