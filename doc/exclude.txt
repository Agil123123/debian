File-based exclusions
=====================

A file called `LOCAL/exclude.conf`, where `LOCAL` is Debsources local directory
(`local_dir` configuration entry), can be used to exclude specific files from
Debsources operations.

Files are excluded just after extraction, removed from the DB, and not further
processed by any plugin.

The file is a Deb822-like file made of several stanzas (or "paragraphs"),
separated by empty lines. The general stanza format is as follows:

	Explanation: (optional) some commentary explaining the exclusion
	Package: affected source package
	Files: UNIX-style glob of files to exclude
	Action: remove

`Files` field is space separated. All fields are "folded", i.e. they can be
broken into several physical lines, indenting subsequent lines by one space.

`Package` an `Files` concur to identify the files to be excluded, as follows:

- initially, all files of (any version of) `Package` are eligible for exclusion

- eligible files are filtered using `Files`: only files that match at least one
  of its glob patterns are retained.  Patterns are matched relatively to
  package root directories, AKA their extraction directories

After the evaluation of the above fields, all files eligible for exclusion get
excluded, executing the given `Action`.

Supported actions, i.e. valid fields for `Action` are:

- `Remove`: remove excluded files from both the package extraction directory
  and Debsources DB.


Maintenance
-----------

Note that changes to `exclude.conf` do not trigger re-extraction of a package.
If you change `exclude.conf` to exclude a file, you will need to remove the
package from debsources and update again to have the exclusion take effect;
similarly if you drop a previously enacted exclusion.


Examples
--------

	Explanation: #742605
	Package: chromium-browser
	Files: foo/bar.c
	Action: remove

	Explanation: non free, non redistributable, see #XXXXXX
	Package: bad-bad-package
	Files: baz/qux/*/*.c
	Action: remove
